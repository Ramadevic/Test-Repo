**Title: Snowflake DevOps Process with DBT and GitHub**

---

### **1. Objective**

To establish a comprehensive, automated, and governed DevOps process for managing Snowflake development lifecycle using GitHub and DBT.

---

### **2. Scope**

* Applies to all Snowflake environments (Dev, UAT, Prod)
* Covers SQL object changes (schemas, views, procedures)
* Includes DBT project integration
* Incorporates version control and CI/CD practices using GitHub

---

### **3. Governance**

* All code changes are tracked via GitHub
* Mandatory peer review and approval before merge
* Deployment is performed via CI/CD with logging and traceability
* Environment access and roles are governed via RBAC in Snowflake

---

### **4. Assumptions and Dependencies**

* Developers have access to GitHub, Snowflake, and CI/CD tools
* DBT is configured and linked with Snowflake
* Secrets are managed via a secure vault
* Network access to Snowflake is available for CI/CD runners

---

### **5. Snowflake DevOps Architecture**

**Components:**

* Source Control: GitHub
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions / Jenkins
* Transformation: DBT
* Data Warehouse: Snowflake

**Flow:**
Developer -> Git Feature Branch -> Pull Request -> CI/CD -> Deploy to Snowflake

---

### **6. Prerequisites**

* Snowflake account setup with roles and warehouses
* GitHub repository initialized
* CI/CD agent setup with credentials
* DBT profile.yml configured with Snowflake connection

---

### **7. Snowflake Deployment Operating Model**

* Changes are pushed to a feature branch
* Merges are only allowed via PRs
* CI/CD deploys approved changes to environments in sequence
* Only tagged releases are promoted to production

---

### **8. Using Schema Changes in a CI/CD Pipeline**

* Schema changes (CREATE/ALTER TABLE) are written in versioned .sql files
* CI/CD parses these scripts and applies them in a defined order
* Success/failure is logged with error handling and rollback

---

### **9. File Naming Conventions**

* `V<version_number>__<change_name>.sql`
* Example: `V001__create_customer_table.sql`

---

### **10. Key File Types in Schema Change**

* `.sql` – DDL and DML changes
* `.yml` – DBT metadata and configurations
* `.py` – Optional scripts for custom logic

---

### **11. Versioned**

* Every schema change file is versioned sequentially
* Version is reflected in filename and tracked in Git history

---

### **12. Repeatable**

* Scripts are written idempotently where possible (e.g., `CREATE OR REPLACE`)
* Ensures safe re-runs without duplication or error

---

### **13. Always**

* Always apply schema changes in the same order across environments
* Maintain consistency between Dev, UAT, and Prod

---

### **14. Change History Table**

* A metadata table in Snowflake (`SCHEMA_CHANGE_LOG`) records:

  * Script name
  * Version
  * Author
  * Applied timestamp
  * Status (Success/Failure)

---

### **15. Branching Strategy for Snowflake**

```text
main (Production)
│
├── uat
│   └── dev
│       └── feature/<feature-name>
```

* `main` = Production
* `uat` = Pre-production testing
* `dev` = Integration of features
* `feature/*` = Individual developer work

---

### **16. Merging Mechanism / Code Merging Process**

* Developers create PRs from `feature/*` to `dev`
* PR requires at least 1 reviewer approval
* Upon successful CI test, changes are merged to `dev`
* Periodic merges from `dev` to `uat`, and then to `main`

---

### **17. POT (Proof of Testing)**

* Each PR must include:

  * Test evidence (e.g., screenshots, logs)
  * DBT test results
  * Data validation output (if applicable)

---

### **18. Approvals**

* At least 1 peer review is required
* UAT to Prod merge requires Lead/Manager approval
* Approvals are documented in GitHub PR history

---

### **19. DBT Prerequisites**

* `profiles.yml` with Snowflake credentials
* Project with models, seeds, snapshots structured
* Tests and documentation included in DBT structure
* Git repo initialized for DBT project

---

### **20. Branching Strategy for DBT using GitHub**

Follows same strategy as Snowflake:

```text
dbt-main (Production)
│
├── dbt-uat
│   └── dbt-dev
│       └── feature/<feature-name>
```

* Keep DBT and Snowflake code in separate folders within the same repo or separate repos

---

### **21. High Level Process Flow**

```
Developer --> Git Branch --> Code Commit --> Pull Request --> Code Review --> CI/CD Validation --> UAT --> Approval --> PROD
```
